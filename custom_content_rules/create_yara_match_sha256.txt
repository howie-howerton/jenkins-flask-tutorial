To create a custom YARA signature to match based on a SHA256 hash match, do the following:

- Use the 'yaratest.yara' as a base template (MAKE A COPY!!!)
- Create a new file (ie: match-me.txt) with some text in it.  Can be any text you like.
- Save the file.
- Get the SHA256 of the file:

shasum -a 256 match-me.txt

- Overwrite the existing SHA256 hash in the copy of the yaratest.yara file with the new hash.
- Also update the rule name (avoid using '-' in the rule name), description and severity as desired.
- Save the new .yara file
- test with:

yara match-me.yara match-me.txt

-- A successful match will output "matchme_test match-me.txt"
